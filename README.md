## My process
- i had to re-sketch it on figma because free users weren't given figma files
- after sketching i started writing the codes
- had a little error when resizing, the whole container would shift to the right when resized to smaller window. Probably as
a result of me using margin to position, so eventually had to use flexbox property.
### Built with
